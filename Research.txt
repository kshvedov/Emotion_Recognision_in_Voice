1) Excluding any rhythm related analisys

2) Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) -- > https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705812023053
	librosa.feature.mfcc(y=dat, sr=sr, n_mfcc=40)
		MFCC is used quite often for more than just sound analisys. Quite often used with voice analisys.
		Whole study written where is is used for language idetification
		
3) Short-time Fourier Transform
	librosa.feature.chroma_stft(S=stft, sr=sr)
		Used to identify the frequencies within the audio file
		Used quite often to idetify key notes or tonalities of a track/music file
		When averaged, allows a person to find the Key of a track.
		
4) Mel Scale
	librosa.feature.melspectrogram(dat, sr=sr)
		Humans dont perceive frequencies in a linear fashion. We can easily tell the difference between
		500 and 1000 Hz, but can bearly tell the difference between 10,000 and 10,500 hz even though the
		distance btween the two pairs is the same.
